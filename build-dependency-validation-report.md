# Dependency Validation Complete

## Analysis Summary
- **Turbo Configuration**: Optimized with better input tracking and environment variable handling
- **Build Dependencies**: Working correctly with proper ^build dependencies
- **TypeScript References**: CLI package correctly references 17 upstream packages
- **Cache Performance**: Turbo cache working efficiently (cache hits observed)

## Optimizations Applied
1. **Enhanced Input Tracking**: Added scripts/**/* to build inputs for better cache invalidation
2. **Build Info Tracking**: Optimized TypeScript build info file tracking in dist directories  
3. **Environment Variables**: Added passThroughEnv for NODE_ENV and CI variables
4. **Selective Dependencies**: Maintained ^build dependencies for proper build ordering

## Validation Results
- Build system fundamentally sound
- No critical dependency issues found
- Package workspace correctly configured
- TypeScript project references properly structured

## Performance Impact
- Better cache invalidation through improved input specifications
- Maintained build ordering through proper dependency declarations
- Enhanced environment variable handling for CI/CD compatibility

The build dependencies are correctly configured and optimized according to the build analysis recommendations.

## üí° Ignore File Configuration

Some linting issues may be in files that shouldn't be linted. **Important:** Only modify ignore files (.ruffignore, .eslintignore, etc.) if there are genuine files that are inappropriate for linting (generated files, vendor dependencies, etc.). Do not use ignore files as a quick fix for linter errors that should be resolved in the code itself. Consider updating your ignore files:

**General patterns (both `.ruffignore` and `.eslintignore`):**
```
dist/
.vite/
coverage/
```

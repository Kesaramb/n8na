      "prompt": "Perform a comprehensive code review with focus on: Confirm test coverage is 100% on important modules and 90%+ on others, with all tests passing\n\nCheck the entire codebase and ensure this criterion is met.\n\n## CRITICAL FAILURE RESPONSE PROTOCOL\n\nIF TEST COVERAGE INSUFFICIENT: Create specific TASK CREATION tasks in TODO.json to achieve required coverage:\n- Test framework setup tasks (Jest/Mocha/Vitest)\n- Unit test creation tasks for all modules\n- Integration test development tasks\n- Test coverage reporting setup tasks\n- CI/CD test integration tasks\n\nCRITICAL: Use TaskManager API to add these tasks immediately when coverage is below requirements.\n\n## SUCCESS CRITERIA\n- Mark this review task as completed ONLY if the criterion is fully met\n- If criterion fails, you MUST create remediation tasks using TaskManager API before marking review as completed\n- All new tasks should be actionable, specific, and include proper dependencies/important_files parameters\n\n## TASK CREATION REQUIREMENT\nWhen creating remediation tasks, ensure each task includes:\n- Clear success criteria\n- Appropriate mode (DEVELOPMENT/TESTING/REFACTORING)\n- Specific file dependencies\n- Realistic time estimates\n- High priority for critical issues\n\nUse the task-creation.md guidelines for optimal task structure.",

    "prompt": "Run test coverage analysis for the @n8n/chat package to identify specific untested code paths. Tasks:\n\n1. Navigate to packages/@n8n/chat/ directory\n2. Run the test suite with coverage reporting (try npm run test:coverage, npm test -- --coverage, or vitest --coverage)\n3. Analyze the coverage report to identify:\n   - Current coverage percentages (statements, branches, functions, lines)\n   - Specific files with low coverage\n   - Untested code paths and functions\n   - Critical areas that need immediate attention\n4. Generate a detailed coverage report showing exactly what needs to be tested\n\nProvide specific data on:\n- Current coverage statistics\n- Files with coverage below 80%\n- Specific functions/methods that are untested\n- Code paths that need edge case testing",

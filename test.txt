Apologies, this was a personal project/exercise on exploring and rehashing frontends of large-scale projects as well as exploring using docker swarms to provision individual isolated instances. I accidentally raised a PR to the upstream. This was not intended to violate ToS as it was a personal project and not to be distributed. Since the previous commits included sensitive PII, I have rewritten the commit history and reclosed this PR. Thanks and apologies again.
